# Study-Journal
A documentation of my personal progress in preparation for my masters in data science. For now, it's kind of a mess and these seem to be more of data pre-processing and exploratory analysis projects for now.

Expect a steady stream of unfinished analyses since most of these are just for practice purposes. Hoping to one day get meaningful insights from all this.
